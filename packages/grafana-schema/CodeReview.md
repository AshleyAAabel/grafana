## Code review for https://github.com/AshleyAAabel/grafana/blob/main/packages/grafana-schema/src/common/common.gen.ts

  While some of the exports on this page have proper documentation, the majority of the exports still have the documentation listed as TODO. Though many of the names for the exports are descriptive and their functionality can be assumed, there is still some ambiguity. It would be a good idea to finish the documentation as figuring out what some of these exports do can seem a little intimidating.

  This is a similar instance to file listed above, except for this file there is no TODO listed for the documentation. It is unclear whether documentation is intended for these exports, but adding them would be a good idea. Not only would it make the function of these exports more clear, but it is also suggested by the code guidelines.
